# Comparative Analysis of Blood Pressure Medications: Lisinopril, Moexipril, and Ramipril

This project compares the effectiveness of three antihypertensive medications—Lisinopril, Moexipril, and Ramipril—in reducing systolic blood pressure. Data from 12 participants were analyzed using ANCOVA, adjusting for baseline systolic pressure to isolate drug effects. Results showed that both Lisinopril and Moexipril were significantly more effective than Ramipril. Randomization was verified using a permutation test, and model assumptions were confirmed. Findings suggest Moexipril may offer the greatest reduction in systolic blood pressure, though larger studies are needed to confirm results.

**Key Methods:** ANCOVA, permutation test, descriptive statistics, and visualization with ggplot2.  
**Tools:** R (tidyverse, ggplot2, emmeans).
